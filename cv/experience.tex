   \cvitem{}{Search for supersymmetry in 13TeV proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC}
\vspace{0.1cm}
   \cvitem{}{Held a key role in ensuring the results from the $\alpha_T$~search for supersymmetry were among the first to be shown publicly with  $2.3{fb}^{-1}$ of data at CERN in November 2015
   and with $12.9{fb}^{-1}$ of data at ICHEP16}
\vspace{0.1cm}
   \cvitem{}{ Responsible for developing the statistical analysis of the search as well as looking at new variables and strategies to optimise sensitivity to a wide range of models}

   \cvitem{}{ Worked on development of python framework for analysis. }
\vspace{0.1cm}
   \cvitem{}{ For the CMS collaboration, worked to develop the jet algorithm for the Stage 2 upgrade of the CMS level-one trigger, particularly focusing on novel methods of pile-up subtraction}

\cventry{Summer 2012}{Undergraduate research opportunities programme (UROP)}{Imperial College London}{}{}{}
\vspace{0.1cm}
\cvitem{}{As part of the MasterCode collaboration, recast searches for supersymmetry at the LHC for use in a scan 
of GUT scale models to determine the impact of these searches on the SUSY parameter space}
