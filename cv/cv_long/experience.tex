   \cvitem{}{As the co-convenor of the CMS long-lived particle subgroup I am responsible for organising and reviewing the CMS long-lived particle analyses. In addition, with my co-convenor I organised the first CMS long-lived particle workshop to identify and find solutions to common problems in long-lived particles searches as well as develop new ideas for the future.}

   \cvitem{}{Physics analysis coordinator for the milliQan experiment and have extensive involvement in the design, building and operation of the milliQan demonstrator that has been collecting data since 2017. I coordinated a search for millicharged particles that has been submitted for publication in PRD.}

   \cvitem{}{Pioneered the use of calorimetry timing information to search for hadronic decays of neutral long-lived particles. This lead to the first published search for BSM physics with the full $137~\text{fb}^{-1}$ 13 TeV data set from the CMS experiment.}

   \cvitem{}{Developing new hardware triggers for long-lived particles using new information from the CMS hadronic calorimeter.}
\vspace{0.1cm}
   \cvitem{}{Developing a search for hadronic decays in the CMS muon system. This represents the first such use of the CMS muon system and has the potential to provide new sensitivity for highly displaced decays.}

   \cvitem{}{Lead the analysis efforts for the milliQan demonstrator experiment to search for millicharged particles at the LHC. This result forms the basis of a paper submitted to PRD with new sensitivity to fractionally charged particles.}
\vspace{0.1cm}
   \cvitem{}{Worked with collaborators to develop new tools for reinterpreting the likelihood model of searches. This formed the basis of a paper published in JHEP.}

   \cvitem{}{Search for supersymmetry in 13 TeV proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC.}
\vspace{0.1cm}
   \cvitem{}{Held a key role in ensuring the results from the $\alpha_T$~search for supersymmetry were among the first to be shown publicly with  $2.3~\text{fb}^{-1}$ of data at CERN in November 2015
   and with $12.9~\text{fb}^{-1}$ of data at ICHEP16.}
